            <h2>What is a Web Server?</h2>
            <p>At its core, a <b>web server</b> is a computer program that processes requests made by web browsers and serves them with the appropriate web pages and data. It acts as a digital waiter in the vast restaurant of the internet. When you type a URL into your browser, the browser sends a request to the server that hosts that website. The server then locates the requested HTML file, image, or other asset and sends it back to your browser, which then renders it for you to see. This entire process happens in milliseconds.</p>
            <p>Beyond simply serving static files, modern web servers can also execute server-side scripts (like PHP, Python, or Node.js) to generate dynamic content, manage databases, and handle complex requests. They are the essential link between a user's device and the website's data and functionality.</p>

            <h2>How a Web Server Works</h2>
            <p>The client-server model is the foundational principle of the web. Hereâ€™s a simplified breakdown of the process:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A user enters a URL (e.g., `www.example.com`) into their browser, the  client .</li>
                <li>The browser translates the domain name into an IP address using the  Domain Name System (DNS) .</li>
                <li>The browser sends an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the web server at that IP address.</li>
                <li>The <b>web server</b> receives the request, processes it, and finds the requested file(s).</li>
                <li>The server sends an  HTTP response  back to the browser, containing the requested files.</li>
                <li>The browser receives the files and renders the web page on the user's screen.</li>
            </ol>

                <h3>Nginx</h3>
                <p>Pronounced "engine-x,"  Nginx  is a high-performance web server known for its efficiency and scalability. It was originally created to solve the "C10K problem" (handling ten thousand concurrent connections) and is a popular choice for high-traffic websites. Nginx is commonly used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache, in addition to its role as a primary web server. </p>
